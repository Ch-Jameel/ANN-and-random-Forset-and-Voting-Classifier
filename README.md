# Human Activity Prediction Using Sensor Stream Data
This project focuses on predicting human activity using sensor stream data. The dataset consists of various sensor readings recorded over time, capturing different human activities. The aim is to classify these activities using multiple machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest, and a Voting Classifier.
